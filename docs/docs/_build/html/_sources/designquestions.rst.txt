Vault Architecture Design Q&A
=============================================================

Here we will discuss and capture requirements for the Vault architecture.

Administration & Maintenance
******************************

* Do you want us to install, run, and operate your Vault cluster?
* What are your SLA requirements?  For example, can your applications tolerate an outage of a few seconds when deploying?
* How often will the cluster and plugin be updated?
* How often will vault versions be updated?

Topology
***************
* What is your preferred deployment?
   GKE

* Do you have any multi-region or HA/DR requirements?
* What about load balancers and whitelisting of public and/or private Endpoints?  Our recommendation is to only allow internal access to the Vault cluster.
* How highly available should it be?  We recommend running in 3 zones generally.
* How many environments will you run?
* Do you have a preferred storage backend for Vault?  We recommend GCS: https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration/storage/google-cloud-storage.html

Security
***************
* How do you currently handle user access in GCP?
* How do you provision certificates today? How will we get certificates for Vault in the pipeline?
* How will users access the Vault cluster?  Should we implement OIDC or is some other authn/z used?
* How important is security?  For example:
    - Do you want us to CIS harden everything?
    - Do you want us to do penetration testing?


Other Details
***************

* How do you handle logging/log storage?
* What about monitoring?  You mentioned you would like to explore Prometheus instead of DataDog?
* What is your backup strategy?
