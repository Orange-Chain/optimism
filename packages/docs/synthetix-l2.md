# Synthetix Demo FAQ

## What is the L2 Synthetix demo?

Synthetix on L2 is a demonstration of the power of Layer 2 for Ethereum--Web2 UX, Web3 features, and a backend ready for mass adoption. With Optimistic Ethereum, this power comes to the fingertips of any Ethereum dApp with just a few lines of code.

## How does Optimistic Ethereum work?

Optimistic Ethereum is a layer 2 scaling solution powered by The Happy Stack: the OVM \[link to OVM explainer\] running on ORU \[link to ORU article\]. Together, the two make for web3 magic.

## What are the UX benefits of Optimistic Ethereum?

Optimistic Ethereum is the Ethereum you know and love--just with:

* Instant cryptoeconomic confirmations
* Orders of magnitude better cost & throughput. 
* Support for native meta-transactions/account abstraction
* No painful gas UX

## How does Optimistic Ethereum compare to other scaling solutions?

* Full EVM support--any Ethereum dApp works with just a few lines of code
* No moon math. \(SNARKS, STARKS, etc.\)
* Not a sidechain. \(Data availability on ETH 1.0\)
* Smart contracts \(Generalized, interoperable\)
* Simple infrastructure. \(No consensus\)

## How many transactions per second?

* ETH 1.0 \(today\): ~200 tps
* ETH 1.0 \(optimized\): ~2,000 tps
* ETH 2.0 \(sharded\): 2,000 \* \# of shards

## Is Optimistic Rollup secure?

Yes. Data availability on mainnet Ethereum guarantees anyone can challenge invalid transactions.

## Whatâ€™s missing from this demo?

Layer 2 deposits and withdrawals. Instead, we airdrop testnet tokens to your wallet.

## How do I build a dApp on Optimistic rollup?

Alpha code and documentation for the OVM can be found here! It's not ready for mainnet _yet_... but stay tuned!
